This is the public repo for my current website using Google Appengine, Jinja, and python. 
<br><br>
This is routinely updated to add back-end features to the website largely for my own ease of use. I commit regularly and typically add features as I come up with them. 
<br><br>
Current todo:<br>
    - Add admin dashboard for the unnamed CMS that I am building for the site. <br>
    - Fill in content and pages<br>
    - Add projects tab<br>
    - build portfolio page for the hidden back-end features on the site<br>
    - Add query for pricing page<br>
    - Add css for cards on pricing page
<br><br>
